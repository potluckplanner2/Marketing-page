      <h2>We Understand the struggle!</h2>
      <p>
        Here at Potluck Planner we understand the complications of planning a
        potluck because we've gone through the same troubles you have! We took
        our frustration and decided to make the solution. Thus Potluck Planner
        was born! We thought of every issue we came across while trying to plan
        our own events and tried to make a system in which all those problems
        would be solved, and the best part is that this is all FREE! All we ask
        is that you register for an account.
